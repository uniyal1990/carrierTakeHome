# Carrier Inc. Data Science & Innovation Take Home Challenge

A short data science project used to assess a candidate's critical-thinking, Python 3 coding, data cleaning, and applied analysis skills.

## TIME
*  A candidate with 3 years of hands-on experience in data science should be able to complete this challenge in ~2 hours.
*  There is NO time limit. Candidates may spend as much time as they want on the challenge before submitting it.

## SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS
A solution submission must be…
*  Written in Python 3.
*  Shared via GitLab, GitHub, or Binder.
*  Include a fully-executed Jupyter notebook.  For security reasons, we will not be running any submitted code.
*  Include predictions for all 20 cases in the `_zeta-disease_prediction-data_` dataset.
*  Complete when it is submitted.  We will only score the first submission.
*  The candidate’s own, original work.  Evidence of plagiarism will be grounds for rejecting the submission.

## THE CHALLENGE: Zeta Disease Prediction

### INTRODUCTION

Mars Mission Control needs a good data-driven system for predicting Zeta Disease infection on the International Mars Colony.
Use the `_zeta-disease_training-data_` dataset to build a model that can predict who will be infected by Zeta Disease.
Apply your model to the `_zeta-disease_prediction-data_` dataset to predict who will be infected by Zeta Disease.

### DATASET

The dataset includes 9 columns with information on 800 people.
1.	age : in years
2.	weight : body weight in pounds (lbs)
3.	bmi : Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)2)
4.	blood_pressure : resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
5.	insulin_test : inuslin test value
6.	liver_stress_test : liver_stress_test value
7.	cardio_stress_test : cardio_stress_test value
8.	years_smoking : number of years of smoking
9.	zeta_disease :
              1 = yes;
              0 = no
